## Echos

The intention of the project was to create an environment that allowed users to use sound to communicate to each other.

A single user will stand, pick up a speaker object and rotate it until it reaches a certain tone, then upon release it is pushed forward and emits that sound. Adding more users allows for music to be made together or for each other. Unfortunately, this idea proved much more difficult to implement than planned. Currently, the user can pick up a speaker, and place it back down by clicking above the stand. They can also add and remove objects.

I found it extremely difficult just to get simple functions up and working. On top of that the learning curve for AFrame made me take significantly more time than I planned to need on this project. Just getting comfortable with programming on my own again versus along with lectures took some time. I learned the importance of components and just how useful they can be near the last hour or two working on the project. I will definately utilize them better in the future.

The most challenging part was trying to build interactions that worked on mobile and desktop. I realized the framework doesn't necessarily have good ways to simply switch over functionality. Knowing the constraints of the framework now, it would have been better to design the interactions with object differently. I expected it to act more like the Bootstrap framework where simply changing a class or componenet would allow for perfect cross-over interaction.
